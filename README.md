# BTS-Bot

### 👩🏽‍💻 About the Project
This is a Discord bot I made during Hydrangea Hacks in the summer of 2021 (now [Hydra Hacks](https://hydrahacks.org/)) and improved after [StarHacks II](https://www.starhacks.tech/) in January of 2022. Using the command `!bts` tells the bot to send a random picture of BTS or a BTS member in a Discord chat, as well as a link to listen to BTS on Spotify.

### 💡 My Inspiration
BTS is a group that I had been listening to for a little over three years when I made this Discord bot, and I thought it would be fun to combine my interest in their music with my passion for coding.

### 🛠 Made With
`Replit (IDE)` `node.js` `Discord.js` `Discord`
